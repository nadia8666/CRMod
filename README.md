# Features:  

- Character modification mod that changes character functionality to remove clunk.
  + Some changes use janky workarounds that aren't very pretty but function well enough.

## Key:

- Adjustment, adjusts certain moves to feel better/play differently
- C_Character, custom character
 
## Changes

- [x] - Adjustment: Mario, Up B no longer has special fall and will turn you around if holding opposite direction

- [ ] - C_Charater: Sukuna, TBD
